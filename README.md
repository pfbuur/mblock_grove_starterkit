Seeed Grove Starter Kit Extension for MakeBlock (version 3 in any case)
- Most of the code originates from Seeed Grove extension by Wangyu(wangyu@makeblock.cc) and 'smile' extension by Arne Bernin (arne@alamut.de)
- extended and added upon existing functions to cover the additional components found in the Seeed Grove Starter Kit: LCD, servo and temp sensor.

For local use:
- after cloning the repo, zip the git folder and import it into mBlock using 'manage extensions'
